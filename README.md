# Homemade Linear Regressor

This project marks the beginning of a journey towards a goal I have set for myself: **Gain a deep understanding of the theory behind the several foundational machine learning models by building them from scratch.** I've always wanted to intimately understand all the math that goes into these imprssive algorithms and I think this is an exciting way to do it. The rest of this README, as well as those for my other  homemade models, is nothing novel and more just a place for me to document everything I've learned.
